The Designated\n    Record Set includes financial and health information referred to in this Notice as \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d\n    (\u201cPHI\u201d) or simply \u201chealth information.\u201d We are required to adhere to the terms outlined in this Notice. If you have\n    any questions about this Notice, please contact our HIPAA Officer.<\/p>\n\n<h2>UNDERSTANDING YOUR HEALTH RECORD AND INFORMATION<\/h2>\n<p>Each time you are admitted to our Practice, a record of your stay is made containing health and financial\n    information. Typically, this record contains information about your condition, the treatment we provide and\n    payment for the treatment. We may use and\/or disclose this information to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>plan your care and treatment<\/li>\n    <li>communicate with other health professionals involved in your care<\/li>\n    <li>document the care you receive<\/li>\n    <li>educate heath professionals<\/li>\n    <li>provide information for medical research<\/li>\n    <li>provide information to public health officials<\/li>\n    <li>evaluate and improve the care we provide<\/li>\n    <li>obtain payment for the care we provide<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Understanding what is in your record and how your health information is used helps you to:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>ensure it is accurate<\/li>\n    <li>better understand who may access your health information<\/li>\n    <li>make more informed decisions when authorizing disclosure to others<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU<\/h2>\n<p>The following categories describe the ways that we use and disclose health information. Not every use\n    or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and\n    disclose information will fall into one of the categories.<\/p>\n\n<h3>For Treatment<\/h3>\n<p>We may use or disclose health information about you to provide you with medical treatment. We may\n    disclose health information about you to Practice personnel who are involved in taking care of you at\n    our Practice. Different departments of a Practice also may share health information about you in order\n    to coordinate your care. We may also disclose health information about you to people outside the\n    Practice who may be involved in your care after you leave a Practice. This may include family members or\n    visiting nurses to provide care in your home.<\/p>\n\n<h3>For Payment<\/h3>\n<p>We may use and disclose health information about you so that the treatment and services you receive at\n    a Practice may be billed to you, an insurance company or a third party. For example, in order to be\n    paid, we may need to share information with your health plan about services provided to you. We may also\n    tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to\n    determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>For Health Care Operations<\/h3>\n<p>We may use and disclose health information about you for our day-to-day health care operations. This is\n    necessary to ensure that all residents receive quality care. For example, we may use health information for\n    quality assessment and improvement activities and for developing and evaluating clinical protocols.<\/p>\n<p>We may also combine health information about many residents to help determine what additional services we\n    should offer, what services should be discontinued, and whether certain new treatments are effective. Health\n    information about you may be used for business development and planning, cost management analyses, insurance\n    claims management, risk management activities, and in developing and testing information systems and\n    programs. We may also use and disclose information for professional review, performance evaluation, and for\n    training programs.<\/p>\n<p>Other aspects of health care operations that may require use and disclosure of your health information\n    include accreditation, certification, licensing and credentialing activities, review and auditing, including\n    compliance reviews, medical reviews, legal services and compliance programs. Your health information may be\n    used and disclosed for the business management and general activities of the Practice including resolution\n    of internal grievances and customer service.<\/p>\n<p>In limited circumstances, we may disclose your health information to another entity subject to HIPAA for\n    its own health care operations. We may remove information that identifies you so that the health information\n    may be used to study health care and health care delivery without learning the identities of\n    residents.<\/p>\n<p>We may disclose your age, birth date and general information about you in the Practice newsletter, on\n    activities calendars, and to entities in the community that wish to acknowledge your birthday or commemorate\n    your achievements on special occasions. If you are receiving therapy services, we may post your photograph\n    and general information about your progress.<\/p>\n\n<h2>OTHER ALLOWABLE USES OF YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION<\/h2>\n\n<h3>Business Associates<\/h3>\n<p>There may be some services provided in our Practice through contracts with business associates. When these\n    services are contracted, we may disclose your health information so that they can perform the job we\u2019ve\n    asked them to do and bill you or your third-party payer for services rendered. To protect your health\n    information, however, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your information.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Treatment Alternatives<\/h3>\n<p>We may use and disclose health information to tell you about possible treatment options or alternatives\n    that may be of interest to you.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Health-Related Benefits and Services and Reminders<\/h3>\n<p>We may contact you to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment alternatives or other\n    health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care.<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you object, we may disclose health information about you to a friend or family member who is\n    involved in your care. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. In addition, we\n    may disclose health information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your\n    family can be notified about your condition, status and location.<\/p>\n\n<h3>As Required By Law<\/h3>\n<p>We will disclose health information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local\n    law.<\/p>\n\n<h3>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety<\/h3>\n<p>We may use and disclose health information about you to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety\n    or the health and safety of the public or another person. We would do this only to help prevent the\n    threat.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Organ and Tissue Donation<\/h3>\n<p>If you are an organ donor, we may disclose health information to organizations that handle organ\n    procurement to facilitate donation and transplantation.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Military and Veterans<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a member of the armed forces, we may disclose health information about you as required by\n    military authorities. We may also disclose health information about foreign military personnel to the\n    appropriate foreign military authority.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Research<\/h3>\n<p>Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose health information about you for research purposes.\n    For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all residents who received\n    one medication to those who received another, for the same condition. All research projects, however, are\n    subject to a special approval process. This process evaluates a proposed research project and its use of\n    health information, trying to balance the research needs with residents\u2019 need for privacy of their health\n    information. Before we use or disclose health information for research, the project will have been approved\n    through this research approval\n    process. We may, however, disclose health information about you to people preparing to conduct a research\n    project so long as the health information they review does not leave a Practice.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Workers\u2019 Compensation<\/h3>\n<p>We may disclose health information about you for workers\u2019 compensation or similar programs. These programs\n    provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.<\/p>\n\n<h3>OTHER DISCLOSURES<\/h3>\n<p>Reporting Federal and state laws may require or permit the Practice to disclose certain health information\n    related to the following:<\/p>\n\n<h3>Public Health Risks<\/h3>\n<p><b>We may disclose health information about you for public health purposes, including:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Prevention or control of disease, injury or disability<\/li>\n    <li>Reporting births and deaths<\/li>\n    <li>Reporting child abuse or neglect<\/li>\n    <li>Reporting reactions to medications or problems with products<\/li>\n    <li>Notifying people of recalls of products<\/li>\n    <li>Notifying a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading\n        a disease<\/li>\n    <li>Notifying the appropriate government authority if we believe a resident has been the victim of abuse,\n        neglect or domestic violence. We will only make this disclosure if you agree or when required or\n        authorized by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Health Oversight Activities<\/h3>\n<p>We may disclose health information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These\n    oversight activities may include audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities are\n    necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with\n    civil rights laws.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Judicial and Administrative Proceedings<\/h3>\n<p>If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose health information about you in response to\n    a court or administrative order. We may also disclose health information about you in response to a\n    subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute, but only if\n    efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to obtain an order protecting the information\n    requested.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Reporting Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence<\/h3>\n<p>Notifying the appropriate government agency if we believe a resident has been the victim of abuse, neglect\n    or domestic violence.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Law Enforcement<\/h3>\n<p><b>We may disclose health information when requested by a law enforcement official:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>In response to a court order, subpoena, warrant, summons or similar process;<\/li>\n    <li>To identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person;<\/li>\n    <li>About you, the victim of a crime if, under certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain your\n        agreement;<\/li>\n    <li>About a death we believe may be the result of criminal conduct;<\/li>\n    <li>About criminal conduct at the Practice; and<\/li>\n    <li>In emergency circumstances to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the identity,\n        description or location of the person who committed the crime.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors<\/h2>\n<p>We may disclose medical information to a coroner or medical examiner.
